# Comments and empty lines may appear before the subject line.


This is the subject line; it is 50 characters long

An empty line separates the subject line from the message body. For
legibility, the subject line should aim to avoid exceeding 50
characters; but that is a guideline more than a rule and is most helpful
for establishing a practice of separating the subject line from the
message body. The first letter is capitalised and there is no
terminating period.

The message body is any number of paragraphs after the subject line,
each wrapped to 72 characters to facilitate comfortable terminal reading
and quote indentation [1].

# The 72 character line length limit does not apply to comments either, to facilitate file names.
